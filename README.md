# electron-obs

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in concert with OBS.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the Electron documentation, adjusted to use OBS API.

A basic Electron-OBS application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
- `binding.gyp` - To point to OBS SDK.
- `obsapi.cc` - A C++ code to call OBS functions. This app uses synchronous and asynchronous calls.
